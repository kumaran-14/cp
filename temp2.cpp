The current tile bot is in has no other units in it.
transform(DoubleVec2D transform_position)
Transform the bot at transform_position. The bot moves to blast_position and then blasts. A bot can move and transform only if,


NOTE: The bot does not move and transform in the same turn. If it reaches the transform_position in one turn, it transforms only in the next turn.

TowerState state
The current state of the tower. This member tells you what the tower is doing right now, and has values IDLE, BLAST, DEAD.

Blast the tower. The tower cannot blast until it has attained a specific age TOWER_MIN_BLAST_AGE

Helpers

findNearestFlagPosition(const State &state, DoubleVec2D position)
findNearestFreePosition(const State &state, DoubleVec2D position)
bot.transform(nearest_free_position)
This is useful to fortify an area after gaining control over it
getBotById(State &state, int64_t bot_id)
Returns a Bot by reference when provided an actor id
This comes in handy when assigning different bots different tasks and keeping track of their progress

It can be used in the following way
auto &bot_blast = getBotById(state, 1); // Returns a reference to bot with actor id 1
bot_blast.blast(DoubleVec2D(10, 10)); // Making this bot blast

auto &bot_transform = getBotById(state, 2); // Reference to bot with id 2
bot_transform.transform(DoubleVec2D(3, 7)); // Making this bot move to position (3, 7) and transform three

auto &bot_move = getBotById(state, 3); // Bot with actor id 3
bot_move.move(DoubleVec2D(5, 5)); // Making this bot move into a specific position like a flag
NOTE : Returns Bot::null if no bot exists with the given actor id. Bot::null is basically a bot constructed with an id of -1

getTowerById(State &state, int64_t tower_id)
auto &tower_blast = getTowerById(state, 12); // Returns reference to tower with actor id 12
tower_blast.blast();
NOTE : Returns Tower::null if no tower exists with the given tower id . Tower::null is a tower constructed with an id of -1

Bonus
findNearestOffset(const State &state, Vec2D position, std::function<bool(TerrainType type, uint64_t position_count)>)
A general purpose function with which you can find the nearest target position from the source position which satisfies a condition defined by you.

NOTE : Each offset in the map will be checked against this function which is passed the terrain type of that offset and the total number of bots or towers in that offset

It may look a bit scary but can be utilized using this function using C++ Lambda functions.

Let us look at an example where we find the nearest position where there are no bots or towers

auto nearest_desolate_position = [](TerrainType terrain, uint64_t actor_count){
        // Returns any position with actor count of 0 irrespective of terrain
        return (actor_count == 0);
}
